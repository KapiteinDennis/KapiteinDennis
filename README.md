<h2>Hey i'm Dennis,</h2>

<p>
    At the moment I am learning different programming languages such as JavaScript and CSS.
    I also learned the programming language Java myself, i am also satisfied if a program runs smoothly and there are no errors.
    <br>
    There is always time to make things smoother and faster and to learn things.
